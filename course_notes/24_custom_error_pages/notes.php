    Custom Error Pages

    in order to create a custom error page go to: templates->bundles->TwigBundle->Exception 
    and create a error500.html.twig file (type in it whatever and clear the cache of the 
    app -> in prod mode whenever the error occurs, the custom error page is served)

    *the custom error page may be served in prod even without clearing the cache 
    (do it only if it's not served)
